We spent our early days building rovers for the red planet; now, we are applying that same rigor, autonomy, and reliability to solve complex human-robot interaction challenges on Earth.Our philosophy is simple: AI should serve humanity seamlessly. We are starting by revolutionizing the hospitality industry—deploying autonomous agents that bridge the gap between service staff and guests.🛠️ Our Tech StackWe believe in minimal tools and maximum efficiency. We build fast, we build right, and we verify everything.<div align="center"><!-- Tech Stack Badges --><img src="https://www.google.com/search?q=https://img.shields.io/badge/ROS2-Humble-22314E%3Fstyle%3Dflat-square%26logo%3Dros%26logoColor%3Dwhite" alt="ROS 2" /><img src="https://www.google.com/search?q=https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-Python_3.10-3776AB%3Fstyle%3Dflat-square%26logo%3Dpython%26logoColor%3Dwhite" alt="Python" /><img src="https://www.google.com/search?q=https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-C%2B%2B-00599C%3Fstyle%3Dflat-square%26logo%3Dc%252B%252B%26logoColor%3Dwhite" alt="C++" /><img src="https://www.google.com/search?q=https://img.shields.io/badge/Simulation-Gazebo-orange%3Fstyle%3Dflat-square%26logo%3Dgazebo%26logoColor%3Dwhite" alt="Gazebo" /><img src="https://www.google.com/search?q=https://img.shields.io/badge/Hardware-Raspberry_Pi-C51A4A%3Fstyle%3Dflat-square%26logo%3Draspberry-pi%26logoColor%3Dwhite" alt="Raspberry Pi" /><img src="https://www.google.com/search?q=https://img.shields.io/badge/Design-Fusion_360-F57423%3Fstyle%3Dflat-square%26logo%3Dautodesk%26logoColor%3Dwhite" alt="Fusion 360" /></div>📡 Our Engineering ValuesOne Crew, One Mind: We move as a unit. We communicate early and unblock each other instantly.Verification-Driven Development: If it's not tested, it doesn't exist. We define our success criteria before we write code.Mars-Grade Reliability: We build systems designed to run unsupervised. "Good enough" isn't good enough when you're autonomous.Speed through Simplicity: We don't over-engineer. We use the simplest tool that solves the problem and allows us to ship.🎯 Current Mission: Project VestaWe are currently Heads-Down building V1.0 of our Hospitality Interaction Robot.Phase: Q1 MVP (Proving the Core Concept)Focus: Autonomous Navigation & Basic HRIStatus: 🏗️ In Active Development🤝 Join the CrewWe are currently a closed core team, but we are always looking for passionate collaborators, mentors, and future crew members who share our vision.Investors/Partners: Reach out to discuss our roadmap to seed funding.Engineers: Check our public repositories (coming soon) for contribution guidelines.<div align="center"><sub>© 2024 OneCrew Intelligence.
