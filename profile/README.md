## 🌌 Who We Are

We are **OneCrew Intelligence**, a tight-knit engineering team forged at the MARS Research Station.

We spent our early days building autonomous rovers for the red planet.
Now, we apply that same **rigor, autonomy, and reliability** to solve complex human-robot interaction challenges here on Earth.

Our philosophy: **AI should serve humanity seamlessly.**
We’re starting with hospitality—deploying autonomous agents that elevate guest experience and empower service teams.

## 📡 Engineering Values

**One Crew, One Mind**
We move as one—communicate early, unblock instantly, and build together.

**Verification-Driven Development**
If it’s not tested, it doesn’t exist. Requirements define the code, not the other way around.

**Mars-Grade Reliability**
Systems should run unsupervised. “Good enough” isn’t for autonomy.

**Speed Through Simplicity**
We choose the simplest effective solution so we can ship fast and iterate faster.

## 🎯 Current Mission: **Project Vesta**

We’re actively building **V1.0 of our Hospitality Interaction Robot**.

* **Phase:** Q1 MVP — validating the core concept
* **Focus:** Autonomous navigation & foundational HRI
* **Status:** 🏗️ In active development
